******** context.tsx ******** 

Security Vulnerabilities: The code does not validate the type of data passed to the setData() method. This means an attacker could inject malicious data into the application.

Suggested Code Corrections: Validate the type of data passed to the setData() method. This can be done by using a typeguard to ensure only valid data is allowed, or by checking for certain properties that are necessary for the data to be valid.

******** main-2.js ******** 

Security Vulnerabilities:
- There may be a potential vulnerability due to the use of '../../../.storybook/main'. Allowing user input in path segments can allow malicious users to traverse directories and access sensitive files.

Suggested Correction:
- Limit user input to only known directory paths. For example, only allowing user input in the './src/lib' directory would help reduce the risk of malicious users accessing sensitive files. Additionally, use the path.resolve() function to ensure that the directory paths are properly resolved. 

const rootMain = require(path.resolve(__dirname, '../../../.storybook/main'));
